In order to calculate the momental price of the currency basic calculations can be made. 

Example: *1 Dijiot price is 1 second of an average human in the community giving by the local government. With this calculation we can reach;


Total DijIOT Supply: (a*b)=2462961600,00000

Official Life value by datas of Local Government (TL/Gold)  c/4/30 = 0.00015 TL *Small family mother, father, 2 kids

DijIOT (TL/Gold): (d/86400) = 0.00182


DijIOT developped and launched by the Dijital Ronesans Dijital Teknoloji (will be call as Dijital RÃ¶nesans from now on)
